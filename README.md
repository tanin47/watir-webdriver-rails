watir-webdriver-rails
===============

(fork fixes :chrome support) watir-webdriver-rails provides a dead-simple way to use Watir with Rails 3.

Current version
----------------
``
0.0.7
``

Installation
--------

Obtain the driver from http://code.google.com/p/chromium/downloads/list and install it in your path


In your Gemfile, drop the below line

``
gem 'watir-webdriver-rails'
``

and type:

``
bundle install
``

from your command line and Rails's root folder

How to use
-------

In your spec_helper.rb, please place the below lines:
(watir-webdriver-rails uses RSpec as the testing framework)

```ruby

require 'rspec/rails'
require 'watir-webdriver-rails'

WatirWebdriverRails.host = "localhost"
WatirWebdriverRails.port = 57124
WatirWebdriverRails.close_browser_after_finish = true

```

In your integration test file, it should look something like this:

```ruby

require 'spec_helper'

describe "Test something" do

	it "should go to some page and fill textbox" do

		browser.goto "/member"

		browser.text_field(:id=>"first_name").set "Tanin"
		browser.text_field(:id=>"last_name").set "Na Nakorn"

		browser.text_field(:id=>"first_name").value.should == "Tanin"
	end
end

```

browser is of type Watir::Browser. You may interact with it freely.
See http://rubydoc.info/gems/watir-webdriver/0.3.2/Watir/Browser

Issues
----------

On Mac OS X 10.6.8, I have found that if you do not close the browser from the previous test,
your current test will hang because the browser is not initialized.

Please do close the browser before running a new test.
